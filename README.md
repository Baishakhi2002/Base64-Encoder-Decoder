# ***Base64 Encoder Decoder***

***We utilize the Tkinter library, a standard GUI toolkit for Python, to create an interactive and user-friendly interface. The application provides options to select the encoding or decoding mode, input the message, and view the result. You can choose to either encode a message to Base64 or decode a Base64-encoded message back to its original form.***

***Here's a brief overview of the features and components of the Base64 Encoder Decoder Project:***

***Encode Mode: Select this mode to encode a message to Base64. Simply input the message and click the "RESULT" button to view the encoded result.***

***Decode Mode: Choose this mode to decode a Base64-encoded message. Enter the encoded message and click the "RESULT" button to view the decoded result.***

***Clear and Reset: The "RESET" button allows you to clear the input message and result fields, enabling you to start fresh with a new encoding or decoding operation.***

***Exiting the Application: You can close the application at any time by clicking the "EXIT" button.***

***With the Base64 Encoder Decoder Project, you can easily encode or decode messages using the Base64 encoding scheme in a convenient and user-friendly manner. Whether you're working with binary data or need to transmit or store data in a text format, this application provides a simple solution.***

***We hope you find this project useful and enjoy using it for your encoding and decoding needs!***
